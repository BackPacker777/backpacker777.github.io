				<p>One rule of thumb is that the total value of your vehicle(s) should never exceed 50% of your annual income.</p>
				<p>Another good rule of thumb is the 20/4/10 rule:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pay at least <strong>20%</strong> for your down payment.</li>
					<li>Never get a loan longer than <strong>4 years</strong> in length.</li>
					<li><strong>10%</strong> or less of your gross income goes towards <em>all</em> vehicle expenses including loan payments, insurance, gas, registration fees, maintenance, and repairs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, if you are not on track with a retirement account of some kind, you should not be purchasing an expensive vehicle that you don't need, and you should strongly consider purchasing a used vehicle that will be practical and affordable.</p>

				<h2 id="wiki_auto_insurance">Auto Insurance</h2>
				<h3 id="wiki_types_of_coverage">Types of Coverage</h3>
				<p>Your auto policy is broken down into different coverage types. The types are fairly standard company to company and across different states. There is some variation in exclusions and definitions between insurance companies. In addition, different states have different minimum requirements as well as some different coverage options and requirements.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Collision</strong>: This is what most people think of when they picture car insurance. It covers damage to your car resulting from an accident (with another car or stationary object). Collision is usually required when you have a car loan. When you don't have a loan, collision is usually an optional coverage. If you are driving a beater it may not be worth the money to insure, especially if you have an emergency fund to cover a new car in case of an accident. Deciding whether to drop collision is a personal decision. Consider talking to an agent before making any changes to your policy. They can break down your quote and tell you what it costs to keep collision on your vehicle. This will help you decide whether it's worth it.</li>
					<li><strong>Comprehensive</strong> (Comp): Comp is similar to collision but this covers damage to your car caused by an 'act of god' (wind, hail, falling trees, deer, cracked windshield, etc.) Everything else said for collision applies here. However, note that you can have separate deductibles for comp and collision. Many people like having a lower comp deductible to cover the less severe cosmetic damage (hail, glass).</li>
					<li><strong>Property Damage Liability</strong> or <strong>Physical Damage</strong> (PDL or PD): If you're deemed at fault in an accident, this covers the damage to the other car(s) and / or building / property you damage. This is a required coverage with the required limits varying state to state. It's generally recommended to get <em>at least</em> $25,000 of coverage (if not more) even if your state requirements are lower. If the damage you cause exceeds your limits you will be legally obligated to pay the difference out of pocket.</li>
					<li><strong>Bodily Injury Liability</strong> (BI): This is similar to Property Damage Liability, but it covers the person you injure, not the car. BI pays for medical bills, pain and suffering, wage loss, and funeral service. It is primarily used for people in the car you hit but also covers pedestrians you hit and any passengers in your car. However, note that this coverage does not cover you (the at fault driver). The limits with this coverage get a little more complex. There are two limits. Per person and per occurrence. A common example would be 50/100. This means it will cover up to $100,000 for any given accident but each person is limited to $50,000. Like Property Damage Liability, you could be held liable for additional damages if your limits are insufficient. A minimum of 100/300 is recommended.</li>
					<li><strong>Medical Expense / Medical Payments</strong> (Med Pay): This covers your (and your passengers') medical bills. It is a no-fault coverage, so it applies regardless of who caused the accident. This is a great coverage, especially if you have no / limited health insurance. Even if you have health insurance this is nice because there are no deductibles / co-pays. In some PIP states (see below) med pay is not available.</li>
					<li><strong>Personal Injury Protection</strong> (PIP): This varies greatly from state to state and is not offered in some states yet required in other states. Like med pay, it's a no-fault coverage. It will cover your medical bills regardless of who is at fault. However, unlike med pay, there is sometimes a threshold; you must reach a certain amount of medical bills before this coverage kicks in. Another difference is that PIP also covers additional expenses such as wage loss.</li>
					<li><strong>Uninsured / Under-insured Motorist</strong> (UM/UIM): This is an additional coverage and varies from state to state. It basically covers accidents where you're not at fault but the other person doesn't have any / enough insurance. You may be thinking that earlier this page mentioned under BI/PD that if you're at fault you can be held personally liable if your insurance limits aren't sufficient. So why would you need this coverage? If the other party is at fault either their insurance would cover it or they would pay out of pocket. But what if it's a hit-and-run? Or an unemployed bum? The chances of you ever seeing a penny is slim. This coverage protects you when the liable party is unable to pay. The PD portion covers damage to your car and the BI portion reimburses you for medical bills, pain and suffering, and lost wages. So now you're probably thinking "well, I have health insurance plus I already have med pay so why would I need this?" Simple. This offers further protection. If you're in the hospital, unable to work, after the accident this will cover your lost wages. If you require in home care, this will cover it.</li>
					<li><strong>Other</strong>: Depending on the carrier, there may be other optional coverages such as <strong>emergency road side assistance</strong>. These are highly variable, so they will not be covered here.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="wiki_ways_to_save_on_insurance">Ways to save on insurance</h3>
				<p>Here are a few tips on how to save:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Shop around. Talk to an agent. Get a quote online. There are dozens of factors that go into pricing and each company has a slightly different formula. Find the company whose formula works in your favor.</li>
					<li>Pay your bill upfront rather than monthly. Many companies give you a discount for paying right away rather than once a month. Additionally, if you're able to use a rewards credit card to do this you could get additional cash back (just make sure to pay your statement in full to avoid paying interest).</li>
					<li>Adjust your deductibles. Sometimes this makes sense, sometimes it doesn't. It really comes down to how the company prices and how comfortable you are with risk. For example, if some cases, increasing the deductible from $500 to $1,000 would have only saved the driver $8 every 6 months or $1.33/month. In order for this to work out in that person's favor, they would have to go 375 months without an accident. In this situation it wouldn't be worth the extra risk and kept the lower deductible. However, if you feel you're a safe driver and are unlikely to get in an accident, and also have an emergency fund big enough to cover a large deductible, go ahead and increase your deductible and save a few dollars.</li>
					<li>Bundle. Try to get your homeowners / renters through the same company. Most places offer a large discount when you bundle. If you have children / dependents it could also be worth looking into term life as well.</li>
					<li>See if you can get a discount for taking a defensive driving course. Just make sure the discount would offset the cost to complete the course.</li>
					<li>Get usage based insurance (UBI), especially if you do not drive a lot. Many companies offer a discount for installing a device in your car that monitors your driving habits for a few months. On top of the discount offered for installing the device, most companies will then lower your premium further if you have safe driving results.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Ways not to save</h3>
				<p>We all try to save money, but there are some saving tips that could hurt you in the long run:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Do not lower your limits to save a few bucks. You can probably safely lower the collision / comprehensive if you have a large emergency fund, but it is not advisable to lower any of the other coverages.</li>
					<li>Make sure to check reviews before choosing a company. Going with a reputable, better rated company is worth a few extra bucks. When your car is totaled, and you're in the hospital, the last thing you want to deal with is an unresponsive insurance company.</li>
					<li>Don't lie about anything on your application (such as pre-existing damage, etc.). This is illegal can come back to hurt you.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Additional information</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Whenever someone discusses a budget, people often comment on how expensive their insurance is. "Your insurance seems really high. I only pay $XX per month." Although they may be overpaying, it is pointless to compare their price to yours. There are dozens of factors that go into pricing (age, driving history, vehicle, location, etc.). There is simply no standard / reasonable price that applies to everyone. Rather than say their price seems high because you pay less, suggest they shop around and see if there is a cheaper alternative.</li>
					<li>Be careful with carpooling and the use of Uber / Lyft. Your personal insurance will not cover you if you are caught doing this. Carpooling is ok but technically (for most policies) you are not allowed to take money. They can pay for gas, or you switch off who drives each day but if you are accepting 'payment' then you are considered a business not personal.</li>
					<li>Another thing to point out is that auto insurance typically does not cover personal property (purse, laptop, etc.) that is in your car. This would be covered under homeowners / renters. Some auto policies should have an endorsement you can add to get coverage.</li>
